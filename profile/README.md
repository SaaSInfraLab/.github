# SaaSInfraLab – Open-Source SaaS Infrastructure for AWS EKS

## Mission

SaaSInfraLab is a personal open-source project focused on delivering production-grade infrastructure for SaaS applications using AWS EKS, Terraform, and GitOps. It's built for developers, DevOps engineers, and platform teams who want a faster path to secure, multi-tenant SaaS deployment in the cloud.

**Core Principles:**

- **Cloud-Native Architecture** with Kubernetes, containers, and EKS
- **Multi-Tenant SaaS Patterns** for isolation and scalability
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with modular Terraform
- **GitOps Automation** using Argo CD for continuous delivery
- **AWS Best Practices**, aligned with the Well-Architected Framework

## Projects Included

The SaaSInfraLab ecosystem is made up of modular, reusable components:

- **cloudnative-saas-eks** – A complete multi-tenant SaaS infrastructure setup on Amazon EKS
- **terraform-modules** – Prebuilt Terraform modules for VPCs, EKS clusters, RDS, IAM, and more
- **gitops-pipeline** – GitOps workflows using Argo CD for continuous deployment
- **sample-saas-app** – A demo SaaS application showcasing tenant-aware architecture

These repositories are designed to work together or independently, making it easy to adopt and scale based on your needs.
